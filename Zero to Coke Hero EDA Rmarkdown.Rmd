# EDA Introduction, Purpose, & Objectives

### Business Problem:


> Swire Coca-Cola operates extensively, producing, selling, and distributing beverages across 13 states in the American West. The company is known for its regular introduction of new, often limited-time, products aimed at stimulating market demand. However, predicting accurate demand for these innovative products remains a significant challenge. Historical data provides some insight but is insufficient for precise forecasting due to variations in regional and demographic appeal.

> The firm stands at the forefront of the Western US beverage distribution sector, continually launching limited edition products to maintain consumer interest and market dominance. Yet, the uncertainty in demand forecasting for these unique items presents risks of either overproduction or shortages, each carrying potential financial and reputational impacts. The project aims to leverage demographic and historical sales data to enhance the accuracy of demand predictions for future innovative offerings.


### The Benefit of a Solution: 

> A precise demand forecast for Swire Coca-Cola's innovative products is imperative for the company to meet all potential demand without overproducing, thereby maximizing revenue and elevating customer satisfaction. By strategically launching the right products in suitable regions at optimal times, Swire can attain a market advantage, reinforce its position as an industry trendsetter, and foster brand loyalty among increasingly diverse consumers.

### Analytics Approach: 

> Our analytics team is set to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Time Series Forecasting techniques like ARIMA and SARIMA models, and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze over 24 million observations collected over three years. This vast dataset includes sales data for more than 3100 unique products across 13 western states with varied demographics. Our goal is to identify the optimal launch periods for new products and pinpoint the essential attributes contributing to their success, while also managing production-related costs effectively. We will adhere to standard data science methodologies, including the division of data into training and testing sets to ensure the validity of our model predictions and demand forecasts.

> The project presents several analytical challenges. Firstly, we must determine the best approach to integrate external data sources, such as demographic and zip code information, with our primary market demand dataset to enhance regional and demographic-specific demand forecasting. Secondly, the variability in the release durations of historical and future products, ranging from 13 weeks to six months, necessitates tailored analytical approaches to utilize historical data effectively. By addressing these challenges, our team aims to develop robust models that will enable Swire Coca-Cola to accurately forecast demand for innovative products, thereby optimizing inventory levels and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Success Metrics:

> Our success hinges on delivering accurate demand forecasts enabling Swire to balance supply with demand efficiently, ensuring no surplus stock or unmet consumer needs. The effectiveness of our forecasts will be reflected in the company's profitability, evaluated through our modeling outcomes against industry-standard performance indicators.

> We will measure the project's success through the precision of our demand predictions for innovative products against real sales data. Key performance indicators include the model's ability to accurately determine the timing, location, duration, and quantity for each new product launch. These metrics aim to provide Swire with valuable insights, leading to financial benefits and an increased market share for their new offerings.


### Description of the Data:

> Our analysis will be supported by one critical dataset, essential for the construction of our predictive models, and a tertiery secondary demographic dataset. 

> The primary dataset is Market Demand, encompassing historical sales data across diverse product categories, brands, caloric segments, and packaging types. This dataset is extensive, with over 24 million records, presenting significant considerations for data handling and analysis.

> The secondary dataset comprises demographic details including age, income, gender, household income, and segmentation, coupled with zip code information. This allows for a nuanced approach to forecasting, enabling predictions tailored to specific demographic profiles based on historical sales patterns and census data.

> Collectively, these datasets form a comprehensive time series analysis framework, comprising over 24 million observations across 13 features. This includes detailed sales information spanning three years for Swire Coca-Cola products, covering 13 western states and 3100 unique products, segmented into various sales territories, innovation product lines, and brand categories, alongside metrics for seasonal trends, financial impacts, and market dynamics.

### Discussion of Missing Data:

> The data set contains NA values for CALORIC_SEGMENT in its raw form comprising 0.2% (59725 missing values) of the data. Using text analysis on ITEM description, imputation was performed to determine the observation's CALORIC_SEGMENT as either diet/light or regular.

### Scope: 

> At the outset of this EDA endeavor, the project will attempt to concentrate on crafting predictive models and generating business insights for seven specified new products. Deliverables include a PowerPoint presentation highlighting key insights, an annotated report delineating the code and model outputs, and all relevant code posted to GitHub for transparency. Future expansions may encompass tailored models for specific brands, locations, or periods to further refine forecasting accuracy.

### Details: 

> The project team comprises four analysts: Ian Donaldson, Michael Tom, Andrew Walton, and Jake Jarrard. The project is slated for completion and presentation to the client on April 11, 2024, with key milestones including exploratory data analysis completion by February 25, model building by March 24, and presentation finalization by April 10. This timeline ensures thorough analysis and model development, culminating in a comprehensive presentation of findings to Swire Coca-Cola. All members of the analytics team contributed equally to the production of this EDA effort and exploration of the data. 


### Purpose of Notebook:

> The purpose of this EDA notebook is to identify and analyze the Swire Coca-Cola data set looking for hints and clues on guidance of forecasting innovation products in a time series format. Additional feature engineering and data cleaning will be performed to prepare the data for time series forecasting and machine learning models.


### Conclusion: 

> By accurately forecasting demand for innovative limited-release beverages, Swire Coca-Cola can make informed decisions to optimize inventory levels, enhance customer satisfaction, and solidify its position as an industry leader in beverage innovation. The collaborative efforts of the analytics team will furnish Swire with the insights needed to navigate the complexities of new product launches successfully. It would be naive to suppose our EDA captured all of the essential elements we would want to know. Its size and complexity will be nearly impossible to fully understand. Ulimately we will need to break the dataset down into useable sub dataframes that will allow for very boutique feature engineering to capture inherent numeric information in each row, by product, flavor, market region, etc. However, this EDA experience in its entirety answers nearly all essential questions beneath the surface of 24 million rows and billions of dollars of soft drink sales in recent years. 



# SECTION SUMMARIES

> We have provided the following EDA in four sections. Summaries of each follow. Some comments are provided in individual sections when necessary. Most comments are captured inside R code output. Most code has been largely suppressed as has lengthy output. 

## PART 1: SUMMARY STATISTICS & ESSENTIALS 


> Several insights can be derived from the comprehensive review of the market demand datasheet. This section captures the essentials any data scientist would want to hear up front in terms of describing the data. Highlights as follows...

> Upon examination of the DATE column, we observe approximately three years of data. Certain products within the dataset span the entire three years, while others are cataloged for less than six months. Products with shorter durations are likely to be more pertinent to our predictions regarding innovative products.

> The analysis of the DATE attribute proves crucial, suggesting the potential utility of segmenting our models based on varying date ranges, such as 13 weeks or less than six months, to align more closely with the specific queries we aim to resolve.

> Regarding CATEGORY, while energy drinks generate the highest revenue per unit, Soft Sodas (SSD) emerge as the predominantly sold category. This dynamic warrants closer inspection.

> In comparison with other manufacturers, Swire-Coca-Cola (Swire-CC) presents an average performance in terms of total sales revenue and units sold. The concern arises from their lower unit price relative to competitors, leading to higher volume sales required to match the revenue of other manufacturers, which could potentially erode profit margins. Our analysis will thus aim to identify products with higher average unit prices for enhanced profitability.

> Between the two caloric segments, diet/light and regular, both command similar prices per unit. However, regular beverages significantly outperform diet/light in both unit sales and total revenue, indicating a stronger market demand for regular sodas.

> The primary challenge lies in sifting through the voluminous data to determine the most relevant fields and questions for focus. Identifying these areas will enable us to harness the extensive dataset effectively, feeding into the models we develop for robust analysis.


## PART 2: DEEPER DIVE INTO INNOVATION CHARACTERISTICS

> The sales data analysis of Swire Coca-Cola unveils critical insights. Initially, the dataset had 59,725 missing entries, all addressed through text analysis, achieving a state of zero missing values. The dataset covers 152 unique weeks, providing comprehensive weekly data for nearly three years, showcasing consistency in time-series data across two caloric segments, five categories, eight manufacturers, 319 brands, 103 package types, and 3,692 unique product descriptions.

> Delving into product specifics, characteristics emerge, such as Diet Smash belonging to the energy category with three types of packaging. The Sparkling Jacceptabletlester brand offers both diet and regular options, available in diverse packaging, while Venomous Blast provides diet and regular choices, predominantly in "16small multi cup" packages. In manufacturer rankings, Swire holds the third position in sales, with Bubble Joy Advantageous leading in brand sales, followed by Real-Time and Peppy.

> Data analysis indicates a left skew in brand run times, displaying a median of 137 weeks against a mean of 99.1 weeks, reflecting varied brand life spans. In contrast, package tenure shows right skewness, with longer tenures for established package sizes, evidenced by a median of 147 weeks and a mean of 117 weeks. However, 14 package sizes exhibit durations of less than six months, potentially signaling new packaging innovations.

> Seasonal trends present inconsistencies, with missing weeks and notable fluctuations among all analyzed beverages, prompting further examination to clarify whether these arise from data omissions or natural product lifecycle conclusions. This necessitates meticulous validation of product start and end dates, especially for brands with intermittent data.

> In conclusion, the detailed analysis sheds light on significant aspects of Swire Coca-Cola's sales trends and product dynamics, laying a foundation for enhanced forecasting accuracy and strategic product launch planning.


## PART 3: EVEN DEEPER - MODELING EDA

> This segment of the EDA is dedicated to organizing the data into suitable sets for modeling. We aim to identify any data inaccuracies that may lead to incorrect predictions and isolate segments that might introduce noise into the models. The final objective is to discern which attributes of our innovative products currently exist in our dataset, ensuring a clean and relevant data environment for predictive modeling.

> During this phase, we undertook a comprehensive review of the datasets intended for model development. Key tasks included identifying multi-category items and filtering out non-essential categories to enhance model clarity. We noted the potential benefit of excluding data on ongoing sales, which could otherwise obscure the models with irrelevant variability. Additionally, our examination of sales tenure distributions by category underscored the need to incorporate these divergences into our modeling strategy effectively.

> A crucial part of our evaluation focused on the yearly sales distribution, revealing significant month-to-month and group-to-group variations. Recognizing these temporal differences will be instrumental in shaping our models, especially in predicting seasonal trends and consumer behavior.

> Delving into the specifics of modeling our innovation products posed unique challenges, given the sparse data for certain new product launches, including those with novel flavors or categories. Our preliminary analysis highlighted the intricacies and potential obstacles in accurately forecasting demand for these unique items.

> Summarizing our findings, the exploration offers critical insights into our data's complexity and the strategic adjustments needed for our models. As we progress, these insights will guide the enhancement of our modeling techniques, aiming to produce more precise and actionable predictive analytics for our innovative product lines.


## EDA PART 4: DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 


> We used several tools to reshape the provided demographic data. We transformed and un-pivoted criteria, segment, and count and created a wide format dataframe from the original XLS and preserved all numbers. We conducted simple calculations to capture the aggregate population and households of each zip code and then we used the zip_to_market_unit_mapping.csv to assign each zip code to its appropriate Market Segment. We removed all Zip codes that were not associated with a Market Segment. We renamed the columns as appropriate. Our dataset contains all 2232 Zip codes with their respective demographic data in 83 total columns. The following exploration captures the essential elements of only the demographic data prior to associating it with the main Swire dataset. Despite learning a great deal about the demographic data, it remains to be seen if it can be married properly to the main Swire dataset for use in modeling.

## Summary of Data Set and Columns

```{r}

#Quick summary of data inspection and manipulation: 
#1: Factored a number of columns 
#2: Imputed all NA's (The only NAs were in the CALORIC_SEGMENT column and we used text analytics to impute DIET & REGULAR)
#3: Ensured DATE column data type was convered to a date as.Date()
#4: Created a UNIT_PRICE column: swire_df$UNIT_PRICE <- swire_df$DOLLAR_SALES / swire_df$UNIT_SALES

summary(swire_df)


#Outliers: 

# UNIT_PRICE: The Max Unit Price seems very high compared to the rest of the observations; no apparent explanation for this as there doesn't seem to be any products in the data set that should sell for that price. 

# UNIT_SALES: The Max Unit Sales seems very high compared to the rest of the observations. This could be that they have a certain product that is very popular included in the data set, but it would be worth exploring

# The average unit price has a large range when grouped by manufacturers, and SWIRE-CC is near the bottom of this list; since we know that Coca Cola is the largest soft drink manufacturer in the world, it isn't a surprise that the overall price per ounce of soda is likely less than its competitors. 

#KEKES, ALLYS, and PONYS all do significantly less total dollar sales and total unit sales than SWIRE-CC, but all 3 are selling their units at a much higher price; this may prove to be a point worth further discovery as smaller companies that produce in smaller quantities may prove to be a good study for short term product production.

# SSD accounts for the vast majority of total sales in both units and dollars. This is likely to be interepreted as standard soda, both diet and regular - the classics we know and love. Swire-CC generates most of their revenue from this category. Though the "Energy Drink" category may prove to be useful to use in modeling scenarios, it may prove more useful for our team to focus on SSD products when we consider how Swire-CC would launch innovation products.

  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1))

# Energy drinks sell at a much higher price per unit than the other categories. This means that assuming their cost to produce is not much different from the other caloric segments, producing more energy drinks would be an easy way to increase margins and could prove useful in comparing and contrasting innovation products against current sellers in this emerging category. It is also no surprise that the typical energy drink costs 2x at most locations than standard bottled soda products.

swire_df %>%
  group_by(BRAND, PACKAGE) %>%
  summarise(MIN_DATE = min(DATE),
            MAX_DATE = max(DATE),

  filter(DURATION > 30) %>%
  arrange(desc(DURATION))

# As an initial foray into determining the characteristics of "Innovation Products" some of the data surrounding launch and packaging caught our attention. If we were to define innovation products as being in the market for at least 30 days but less than 6 months, we see there are 95 different brand packaging combinations that fit this criteria in our historic data set out of a total of 1720 Package and Brand Combinations. Does packaging matter for an innovation product?

> Comments: The Diet Smash product is a diet product, in the energy category, and comes in 3 packaging types (Innovation - Packaging?). The Sparkling Jacceptabletlester brand comes in both diet/regular, straddles both sparkling water and sparkling soda drink categories, and comes in multiple different package types (but not innovation package "16small multi cup"). The Venomous Blast product comes in both diet and regular, in the energy category product, and comes in 3 packaging types (almost exclusively "16small multi cup", with two short term release sizes, but not future "innovation package?" "16 liquid small"). The Square brand comes in both diet and regular, in the 2 categories (sparkling water and ssd), and comes in 5 packaging types (several have extremely small counts - full innovation packaging?). The Greetingle brand comes in only diet, in the ING Enhanced Water category, and comes in 6 packaging types (all with relatively legit numbers, with the exception of one size). The Diet Moonlit brand comes in only diet, in the ssd category, and comes in multiple packaging types (all with legit numbers). The Peppy brand comes in only regular, in the ssd category, and comes in at least 6 packaging types (all with legit numbers, other could be explored more).

> COMMENTS: Swire is in 3rd place for overall sales behind Jollys and Cocos for overall sales by manufacturer. The top 3 package sizes range from 12small 12one cup, 20small multi jug, and 16small multi cup. Bottom 3 sales by package size are 8.55small mlt shadyes jug, 20 small 15one jug, and 8.55small 6one shadyes jug. Bottom packges sizes are likely innovation package that did not do so well based on extremely small sales (<$40K). Bubble Joy Advantageous (a Coco's regular soda) is a clear winner in sales by brand, followed by real-time (Ally's primarily energy drink in diet/regular), and peppy (Swire-CC's regular soda). Bottom 10 sales by brand all falls into extremely small buckets of sales less than $6k, are these innovation product failures? The bottom three are Mist Twst Nat Cbry (Jolly's 1 single sale of regular soda), Tipcal Canary Twister Soda (1 single sale of Jolly's regular soda), and Vaultless (1 single sale of Coco's diet soda). The sparkling soda drink category is more than double the next (energy). ING Enhanced Water and Sparkling Water register as notable bottled drinks, but coffee barely scratches the surface in terms of sales. Summer and Spring are roughly about the same in terms of sales, followed by a slight drop in Winter, and a more noticeable drop for Fall.

> COMMENT: The top 10 brands that run 148 or 152 weeks do not include some of the top sales by brands (are there missing weeks?). The top 10 shortest running brands include bottom brands by sales and only ran for 1 or two weeks, which makes sense if something only registered one single sale. The median length of a brand is 137 weeks, with mean brand run time falling in a 99.1 weeks. Therefore, the data likely exhibits left skewness, indicating that there are some brands with very short run times (which pull down the mean), while the median is higher due to the influence of some brands with longer run times. The histogram of brand run time shows a left skew with several stalwart brands running for a very long time, and a lot of brands, including innovation types, running for a shorter duration. As can be seen in the density plot there are two main humps or modes, one that clusters between 0 and ~25 weeks (6 months) trending down to a flatter line between week 50 and week 100, and another much larger cluster presumably dominated by the always on the shlef types cluster between 125 and 152 weeks. It may be worth looking for week 0/launch/tenure date spikes for those products that runs less than 6 months in order to determine start/stop times for any ARIMA/Time-Series models later.

> COMMENT: Top 10 packages run the entire length of the dataset, which is 152 weeks. These are tried and true packaging sizes that we have all likely grown up with, know and love to enjoy our beverages from, whether from a gas station or grocery store. The top 10 shortest packages range from 1 week to 7 weeks.  The median package run length is 147, indicating that tried and true packing overwhelmingly dominates distribution sales. The mean package tenure is 117 weeks. Therefore, the data likely exhibits right skewness, indicating that there are some packages with very high tenures (which push up the median), but the mean is lower due to the influence of some packages with shorter tenures. The density plot shows two primary modes, one smaller < 12 weeks, likely innovation dominated, and another larger > 140 weeks, legacy package sizes. There are 14 package sizes that run for less than 6 months or 26 weeks.

> COMMENT: The "Diet Smash" brand has a gap in dates of 42 days. If packaging such as "2L Multi Jug" is added in, Diet Smash has a gap of 35 days. The "regular Sparkling Jacceptabletler brand in the ssd category" has a gap of 42 days. The "Venomous Blast" brand has 2 gaps, one of 35 days and the other of 70 days. The "Square" brand has 7 gap lengths in dates, with the most common of 35 days occuring 3 times, and the longest being 126 days. The "Greetingle" brand has a single gap length of 35 days. The "Diet Moonlit" has a single gap of 42 days. The "Peppy" brand has a single gap of 42 days. Further analysis should be done to ensure start/stop dates for tenure are accurate and that we are not missing weekly data. The question is whether or not this constitutes missing data OR product taken off market and put back into the market based on supply, supply chain, or other business issues.

> COMMENT: In these 5 line graphs we are given the shape of sales from launch date. We see that with the short term products a large spike starts and tapers off as time goes on. "Ongoing" products tend to start strong and then slowly start to fall over time. This demenstrates further that when modeling breaking our items into categories to model will help us be more accurate when looking at forecasting newe products for shorter amounts of time. It also reinforces that we should be able to exclude our ongoing products from the data. 

```{r Sales by Group During Time of Year, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# These graphs show us when forecasting for specific weeks of the year we will have large amounts of variance based on past sales. 
# We may need to look at outliers in the 13 week and 1 year category. 

# Group by sales category and create separate line graphs

> This product proved to be the least common to our current data. The enhanced water segement is very small and has not had any limited releases like this before. Also there has been no sales of this flavor in the past.

> This product grouping as with the last will need to be built on many assuptions. There currently is no other products with CASSAVA in the market. There are 10 itmes that have been sold for 6 months at a time that are in the energy drink category. For this we will need to expand out our data set to hone in on which 6 months of the year would be best. In a graph of sales we do see a window of time that these matching products have sold the most, Feb - July.
